# Threat Intelligence workshop

## Overview

This workshop is designed to be a introductory *course* to the niche security topic - Threat Intelligence.

I am by no means an expert but I believe this is a step in the right direction, after all learning a topic practically is always best.

## Requirements

- a Linux VM with a GUI
- Docker Compose

## Workshop Labs

The labs in this workshop are arranged in an ascending order, where the complexity rises with each lab. There are a total of 3 labs:

1. Install and explore the tools and platforms
2. Identify the Threat Actor
3. Analyze a breach and document your threat intelligence using MISP and MITRE ATT&CK
