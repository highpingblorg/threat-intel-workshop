# Lab 2

The primary objective of this lab is to learn how to apply threat intelligence in an incident response scenario. Fortunately, this will be a straightforward example, so you won't need to analyze an .iso or a .pcap file to identify IoC.

In this lab, the IoC have already been identified; your task is to determine the individual or group responsible for these artifacts. Utilizing the tools from the previous lab or others discussed during the presentation, identify the Threat Actor associated with the following artifacts.

**PLEASE DOWNLOAD AND USE THESE FILES WITHIN A VM, SOME OF THE FILES ARE ACTUAL MALWARE**. Download the `.zip` file containing the IoC [here]().
