# Lab 3

## What happened?

Our organization has recently encountered a security breach. Fortunately, our incident response and forensics team has successfully contained the breach in a timely manner. They have identified several logs and malicious files associated with the incident. Your task is to convert this information into actionable intelligence.

In this lab, you will utilize MISP to analyze and document this intelligence, while employing the MITRE ATT&CK framework to elucidate the methods by which the breach transpired.
