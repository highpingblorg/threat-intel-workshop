# Lab 3

## What happened?

Recently, our organization has experienced a security breach, our incident response and forensics team has found the following logs and malicious files relating to the security breach. Luckily, the breach was contained in time. Your job is to translate this into actionable intelligence.

For this lab you will need to use MISP to analyze and store this intelligence and MITRE ATT&CK to explain how the breach occurred.
